## Online Demo

To allow users to intuitively experience the powerful functionality and convenience of LinkMind, we offer an online demo. You can visit and experience it through the following link: [https://lagi.landingbj.com](https://lagi.landingbj.com/).

## Quick Start

For developers, we provide a simple way to compile and run the LinkMind application. You can choose to use the Maven command-line tool to package, or run it through mainstream Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA. Please make sure you are using JDK version 8 or above.

### Method 1: Using Maven

First, you need to clone the LinkMind project repository and switch to the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/landingbj/lagi.git
cd lagi
```

Next, modify the [`src/main/resources/lagi.yml`](lagi-web/src/main/resources/lagi.yml) configuration file, replace the large language model API_KEY or SECRET_KEY with your own keys, and set the `enable` field of the model you wish to activate to `true` as needed. Detailed configuration methods can be seen in the [configuration documentation](docs/config_en.md).

```yaml
- name: gpt-test
  type: GPT
  enable: true
  priority: 1
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
  api_key: your-apikey
```

Then, use the Maven command to package the project, and the packaged war file will be generated in the `target` directory:

```shell
mvn package
```

Finally, deploy the generated war package to the Tomcat server. After starting Tomcat, you can view the specific page of LinkMind by accessing the corresponding port through a browser.

### Method 2: Using IDE

If you prefer to use an IDE for development, you can directly open the LinkMind project with mainstream IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA. After publishing the project as a web project to the Tomcat server, you can view the interface of LinkMind by accessing the respective port through a browser.

### Method 3: Docker

- Image Name: landingbj/lagi

- Pull Command: 

  ```bash
  docker pull landingbj/lagi
  ```

- Start Container Command: 

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name lagi-web -p 8080:8080 landingbj/lagi
  ```

## Tutorial

To help you efficiently become familiar with and utilize LinkMind, we have prepared a comprehensive set of  [Tutorial presentations](docs/tutor_en.md). Through this tutorial, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can quickly get started. The tutorial also covers the setup of the LinkMind basic environmental vector database, guiding you step by step from the download, installation, and configuration of LinkMind, to actual operation, allowing you to easily start learning and quickly master the operational skills of LinkMind.

## API

The LinkMind project also provides multiple RESTful API interfaces, facilitating users to integrate AI services into their own applications. We have prepared detailed [API documentation](docs/API_en.md) for developers, which you can refer to understand how to use these APIs to enrich your application features.

## Integration

In order to help you better understand and use LinkMind, we provide you with detailed [Guide documentation](docs/guide_en.md). You can refer to this document to understand the structure and content of the project, so that you can quickly invoke relevant features and develop large model applications efficiently. It helps you understand and use a variety of AI features provided in the project. With this guide, you can easily integrate AI features such as text conversation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, and image generation into your applications, achieving a more intelligent and user-friendly interaction experience.

If you wish to integrate LinkMind into your project, you can refer to our [Integration documentation](https://github.com/landingbj/lagi/blob/main/docs/guide_en.md#quick-integrate-into-your-existing-project). This document will guide you through the process of seamlessly integrating LinkMind into your project. In addition, we provide frequently asked questions and best practices to help you avoid common pitfalls during integration, ensuring a smooth progress of your project. It covers comprehensive guidance from setting up the environment to implementing features. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you will be able to quickly integrate LinkMind into your project.

## Extension

If you are not satisfied with the adapted large model for LinkMind, you can also refer to our [Extension documentation](docs/extend_en.md) to extend LinkMind, adapting it to your preferred large model. This document not only covers the methods for adapting and extending functional models and vector databases but also provides expansion examples to help you quickly grasp the methods for extending LinkMind, meeting your specific requirements.

If you find the vector databases currently integrated with LinkMind to be less than satisfactory for your needs, you can also refer to our [Extension documentation](https://github.com/landingbj/lagi/blob/main/docs/extend_en.md#Database-Extension) to expand LinkMind and adapt it to your preferred vector database. This will meet your diverse business requirements, enhance the overall performance and reliability of your system, and provide a more enriching and efficient data management experience.

## Security

In order to better integrate LinkMind into your business, you can add the keywords you need to filter in the [sensitive_word.json](lagi-web/src/main/resources/sensitive_word.json) file, specify the priority keywords in the [priority_word.json](lagi-web/src/main/resources/priority_word.json) file, and set the stopping keywords in the [stopping_word.json](lagi-web/src/main/resources/stopping_word.json) file to change the return results of the conversation, guide the conversation in a specific direction, and automatically stop the conversation when needed.

Example: 

Set the sensitive word filter, level has three values, 1: delete the entire sentence when the sensitive word is matched 2: replace with mask 3: erase (default). mask: mask string (default :...) . rules: represents a list of sensitive rules, where rule for each list element represents the regular expression matching the sensitive word, mask and level are used globally if not specified:   

If `OPENAI` is successfully matched, the `OPENAI` is erased. If `hello` is successfully matched, the `hello` is replaced with `***`. If `people` is successfully matched, use `...` Substitution.

```json
{
  "mask": "...",
  "level": 3,
  "rules": [
    {"rule":"OPENAI"},
    {"rule":"hello", "level": 2, "mask": "***"},
    {"rule":"people", "level": 2}
  ]
}
```

Example：Set priority keywords and stop keywords:

```json
[
  "openai"
]
```

Here’s the English translation of your document:

## Rerank and Embedding Models

Download the [AI database](https://downloads.landingbj.com/lagi/ai-sqlite.zip) and the [Embedding model](https://downloads.landingbj.com/lagi/embedding_2048.model), then configure the AI database and embedding model in the configuration file accordingly.

After downloading the AI database, extract it to any directory and configure the data source as follows:

```yaml
  database:
    - name: ai
      jdbc_url: jdbc:sqlite:{ai_sqlite_path}
      driver: org.sqlite.JDBC
      username: root
      password: 123456
      maximum_pool_size: 160
      idle_timeout: 0
      max_lifetime: 2877700
```

After downloading the embedding model, add the following configuration to enable LinkMind’s embedding model:

```yaml
  embedding:
    - backend: landing
      type: Landing
      model_path: {embedding_model_path}
```

The **Rerank** feature only requires the AI database file, while the **Embedding** model requires both.

For API references, see [API Documentation](docs/API_en.md).
